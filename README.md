To create a registration and login system using JSP, JDBC, MySQL, and Servlets, you need to understand the purpose of each file and how the code flows between them. Below is a detailed explanation of the files and the code flow for both the registration and login processes.
Files and Their Purpose

Registrationservlet.java:
-------------------------
This is a Servlet that handles the registration process.
It receives data from the registration form (registration.jsp), validates it, and stores it in the MySQL database using JDBC.


registration.jsp:
-----------------
This is a JSP file that contains the HTML form for user registration.
It collects user details like name, email, password, and contact number.

Login.java:
-----------
This is a Servlet that handles the login process.
It receives the login credentials (email and password) from the login form (login.jsp), validates them against the database, and redirects the user to the appropriate page.


login.jsp:
---------
This is a JSP file that contains the HTML form for user login.
It collects the user's email and password.


Logout.java:
-------------
This is a Servlet that handles the logout process.
It invalidates the user's session and redirects them to the login page.

index.jsp:
-----------
This is the home page of the application.
It is displayed after a successful login.

mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar:
----------------------------------
This is the MySQL JDBC driver.
It enables the Java application to connect to the MySQL database.

web.xml:
----------
This is the deployment descriptor for the web application.
It maps the servlets to their respective URLs.



Code Flow for Registration Page
------------------------------------
User Accesses Registration Page
-------------------------------
The user opens registration.jsp in the browser.
The registration form is displayed.

User Submits Registration Form:
--------------------------------
The user fills in the form (name, email, password, contact) and clicks the "Register" button.
The form data is sent to the Registrationservlet.java servlet via a POST request.

Servlet Processes Registration Request:
---------------------------------------
The Registrationservlet.java servlet receives the form data.
It connects to the MySQL database using JDBC.
It inserts the user's details into the users table in the database.

Servlet Redirects User:
-----------------------
If the registration is successful, the servlet sets a status attribute and forwards the request to registration.jsp to display a success message.
If the registration fails, it sets an error status and forwards the request back to registration.jsp to display an error message.



Code Flow for Login Page
---------------------------
User Accesses Login Page:
------------------------
The user opens login.jsp in the browser.
The login form is displayed.

User Submits Login Form:
--------------------------
The user enters their email and password and clicks the "Login" button.
The form data is sent to the Login.java servlet via a POST request.

Servlet Processes Login Request:
---------------------------------
The Login.java servlet receives the login credentials.
It connects to the MySQL database using JDBC.
It queries the users table to check if the email and password match.

Servlet Redirects User:
------------------------
If the credentials are valid, the servlet creates a session for the user and redirects them to index.jsp (the home page).
If the credentials are invalid, it sets an error status and forwards the request back to login.jsp to display an error message.




Code Flow for Logout
--------------------
User Clicks Logout:
--------------------
The user clicks the "Logout" link or button.
The request is sent to the Logout.java servlet.

Servlet Invalidates Session:
----------------------------
The Logout.java servlet invalidates the user's session.
It redirects the user to login.jsp.



--------
Summary
---------
Registration: User fills the form in registration.jsp → Data is sent to 
-------------
Registrationservlet.java → Data is stored in the database.

Login: User fills the form in login.jsp → Data is sent to Login.java → 
------
Credentials are validated against the database.

Logout: User clicks logout → Logout.java invalidates the session → User is 
------
redirected to login.jsp.
